# Psychic-Game
At page load the computer will guess any letter between a and z. 
The user then has 10 attempts to guess what letter the computer is thinking of.

A correct guess counts as a win, while 10 failed attempts will count as a loss, 
at which point the game will restart and continue keeping a total score count.

Made with Html, Css, and Js
